Vietnam's healthcare system has been undergoing significant transformations and facing various challenges as it strives to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) and improve the quality of medical services for its population. The country's Ministry of Health (MoH) has been at the forefront of these efforts, implementing a series of regulatory updates and policies aimed at enhancing healthcare delivery and access[20].

One of the notable successes of Vietnam's healthcare system is its progress towards UHC. As of 2020, approximately 90.85% of the Vietnamese population was covered by social health insurance, a remarkable achievement that underscores the government's commitment to making healthcare universal and affordable[17]. This high coverage rate is expected to surpass 95% by 2025, positioning Vietnam's health insurance system as one of the most successful in Asia[19].

However, the Vietnamese healthcare sector is currently grappling with several challenges, including overcrowding in hospitals, outdated medical equipment, and a shortage of qualified medical staff[15]. Public hospitals, which account for 86% of the total hospital number in Vietnam, are particularly affected, with facilities in major cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City operating at double their capacity[15]. This situation has prompted the government to allocate significant public funds for upgrading hospitals in the provinces and to encourage the expansion of private healthcare facilities[15].

The MoH has also been active in updating regulations to improve healthcare system management. Recent updates include Decree 98/2021 ND-CP, which revised the rules governing medical device registration, and Decree 07/2023, which extended the validity of Import Licenses for medical devices and delayed the implementation of certain application requirements[20]. These regulatory changes are part of Vietnam's efforts to ensure that medical devices and technologies meet international standards and are safely accessible to the population[20].

Despite these efforts, Vietnam's healthcare system faces financial challenges, with out-of-pocket expenses accounting for a significant portion of total health expenditure[17]. The fee-for-service model, increased autonomy of public hospitals, and rising demands for high-quality services have contributed to escalating healthcare costs[17]. To address these issues, the Vietnamese government is exploring ways to provide an evidence-based benefits package through its social health insurance and to develop a more efficient healthcare service delivery system[17].

In conclusion, Vietnam's healthcare system is at a critical juncture, with significant achievements in expanding health insurance coverage and regulatory reforms. However, challenges such as overcrowding in hospitals, outdated equipment, and financial sustainability remain. The government's ongoing efforts to upgrade healthcare facilities, improve regulatory frameworks, and ensure financial protection for its citizens are crucial steps towards achieving a robust and sustainable healthcare system that can meet the evolving needs of the Vietnamese population[15][17][19][20].
